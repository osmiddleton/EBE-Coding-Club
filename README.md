# EBE_Coding_Club
Welcome to University of Sussex's Evolution, Behaviour and the Environment (EBE) Coding Club!

# What can I find here?
We will be hosting all code used in the coding club's sessions, as well as any data that is small enough to be hosted here. For those datasets too large to be stored here (e.g. most spatial data layers) we will simply provide links to the location where you can download the data.  


# Coding tutorials
Coding club session will feature some code presented by a/multiple speaker(s) on some aspect of ecological analysis. This will not necessarily involve introductions to the topic, although we will provide a link to some papers which perform these analyses for you to understand the context. If you want to read these in advance, great(!), if not, no worries. 

# Current code available
 - GBIF and Flickr Occurrence Records
