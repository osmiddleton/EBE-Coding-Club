# EBE Coding Club

Welcome to University of Sussex's Evolution, Behaviour and the Environment (EBE) Coding Club!

# What can I find here?
We will be hosting all code used in the coding club's sessions, as well as any data that is small enough to be hosted here. For those datasets too large to be stored here (e.g. most spatial data layers) we will simply provide links to the location where you can download the data.  

# Tutorials
Each coding club session will feature some sort of coding tutorial for some aspect of ecological analysis. This will not involve any introduction to the topic, although we will provide a link to some papers which perform these analyses for you to understand the context. If you want to read these in advance, great(!), if not, no worries. The code for each tutorial are found in the folder with the name of the folder being the date of the coding club. 

So far, and in no particular order, we plan to provide the turorials on the following topics:
- Data visualisation (ggplot2)
- Data ordination (PCoA and NMDS)
- Network analysis (Visualising and metric calculation)
- Functional diversity (FD and FRic)
- Working with phylogenies
