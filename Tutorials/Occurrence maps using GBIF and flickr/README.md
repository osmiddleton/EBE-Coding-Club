Abstract:
iEcology is a new research approach that seeks to quantify patterns and processes in the natural world
using data accumulated in digital sources collected for other purposes.
iEcology studies have provided new insights into species occurrences, traits, phenology, functional
roles, behavior, and abiotic environmental features.
iEcology is expanding, and will be able to provide valuable support for ongoing research efforts, as
comparatively low-cost research based on freely available data.
We expect that iEcology will experience rapid development over coming years and become one of the major
research approaches in ecology, enhanced by emerging technologies such as automated content analysis,
apps, internet of things, ecoacoustics, web scraping, and open source hardware.
