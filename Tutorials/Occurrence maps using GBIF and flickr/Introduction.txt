# Abstract:
# iEcology is a new research approach that seeks to quantify patterns and processes in the natural world
# using data accumulated in digital sources collected for other purposes.

# iEcology studies have provided new insights into species occurrences, traits, phenology, functional
# roles, behavior, and abiotic environmental features.

# iEcology is expanding, and will be able to provide valuable support for ongoing research efforts, as
# comparatively low-cost research based on freely available data.

# We expect that iEcology will experience rapid development over coming years and become one of the major
# research approaches in ecology, enhanced by emerging technologies such as automated content analysis,
# apps, internet of things, ecoacoustics, web scraping, and open source hardware.
